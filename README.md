# Traffic-light-detection
Traffic Light Detection using OpenCV and NumPy This project detects traffic lights and poles in images using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It applies HSV color filtering and edge detection techniques to identify yellow traffic lights and vertical pole structures
# Traffic Light Detection ðŸš¦

## Overview
This project detects traffic lights from images using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**. It utilizes color-based filtering in the HSV color space to identify yellow traffic lights and applies edge detection to detect poles.

## Features
- Detects yellow traffic lights from images
- Identifies vertical poles using edge detection
- Uses **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for processing and visualization

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
